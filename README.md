## Workshop Preparation
Before Day 1, make sure to download the zipped folder that was sent via email (materials can also be found on Repo)

## Schedule
### Lesson 1 (9/22): Welcome to R and RStudio
Lead: Nichole Kulikowski

This session starts from scratch and assumes no prior knowledge. We will learn how to launch RStudio, write basic code, and build a starter toolkit of R-skills that will carry us throughout the rest of the workshop.

### Lesson 2 (9/22): Getting and Cleaning Data
Lead: Sabrina Deeley

This session goes over important R basics using base R, including: naming and creating columns, data checks, selecting for specific data within the larger dataset, combining datasets, and saving/importing excel and csvs into R.

### Lesson 3 (9/23): Summarizing and Exporting Data
Lead: Geoffrey Millard

This session uses a mix of live demonstrations and exercises to build off of skills developed in Lessons 1 and 2 to quickly summarize data into descriptive statistics.  Summary data and tables can be easily exported and shared as .csv files or .html.  If time allows, a brief demonstration of a couple baseR statistics will also be shown.

### Lesson 4 (9/23): Visualizing Data
Lead: Marschall Furman

This session will cover some techniques for data visualization in R, 
primarily with the ggplot2 package, using a water dataset. 

We will learn about the "layers" involved in making graphics, practice customizing 
features of our plots with data, and learn how to adjust the formatting of our charts
